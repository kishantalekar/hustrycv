Color Palette for Fox-Themed Tech App

This animation-rich tech app uses a vibrant orange as its primary hue (echoing the fox mascot), balanced by cool teal and blue accents. Orange is often described as an energetic, attention-grabbing color​

, making the interface feel lively and fun. Pairing orange with a teal/cyan accent creates a modern, high-contrast look​

. Overall the UI stays light and clean: we use a near-white background and neutral grays for text and cards to keep things fresh and airy.
Palette
Primary (Orange): #FA6607 – A bold, energetic orange for primary buttons and highlights. It conveys enthusiasm and stands out vividly​

.
Accent (Teal/Cyan): #00C2C4 – A bright teal accent for secondary buttons or link highlights. This hue draws the eye to CTAs and important elements (turquoise is known to guide user interaction​

) and evokes a clean, fresh feel.
Accent (Blue): #1565C0 – A deep blue (for navigation bars or info labels) that adds professionalism and balance​

. It contrasts well with orange without overwhelming.
Background: #F9FAFB – A very light gray/off-white background keeps the UI fresh and reduces strain​

. Cards and screens use this color so that content and accent colors pop.
Text (Primary): #333333 – Dark gray text on light backgrounds ensures high contrast and readability​

. Use this for body text and headings.
Text (Secondary): #828282 – Medium gray for secondary text (captions, placeholders) to de-emphasize less important information.
CTA (Green): #4CAF50 – A friendly green for special call-to-action buttons (signals “go” or success). This provides a positive accent option aside from orange.
Usage Guidelines
Hierarchy/Contrast: Apply a 60–30–10 rule: ~60% neutrals (backgrounds, surfaces), 30% secondary colors (teal/blue), 10% primary (orange)​

. Use the bold orange sparingly (e.g. main CTAs or active nav items) so it really stands out. Maintain strong contrast (dark text on light background) to meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0 requires ≥4.5:1 for normal text​

​

).
Buttons: Primary action buttons should use the orange #FA6607 background with white text. Secondary or less-critical actions can use teal or blue backgrounds with white text. Orange naturally grabs attention​

, so reserve it for the most important buttons. Use the green (#4CAF50) for success or “go” actions (e.g. Submit, Confirm) as a friendly alternative.
Forms & Inputs: Keep form fields on a light background with subtle gray borders. On focus or validation, highlight the field’s outline or label in the teal #00C2C4 accent to guide the user (turquoise accents draw focus​

). Use the secondary gray #828282 for placeholder text and helper hints. Error or warning states can also use orange or red to signal attention.
Navigation: Use a white or very light nav bar. Highlight the active tab or menu item in orange or teal – for example, an orange underline or teal icon indicates the current page (balancing accents is key​

). Inactive nav text/icons can be dark gray or blue. This keeps the navigation clear without heavy color.
Text & Icons: Display main text in #333333 on the light background to ensure legibility​

. Use the deep blue (#1565C0) for links, buttons, or icons that need emphasis. Secondary labels or captions can use #828282. This approach follows UI conventions (dark text on light background) and provides a subtle hierarchy.
Cards & Surfaces: Use white or #F9FAFB for card backgrounds to separate content. Apply subtle shadows (e.g. black at 5–10% opacity) or a very light gray #E0E0E0 shadow so elements have gentle depth. The neutral tones here allow the vibrant orange/teal accents to pop without clutter.
Imagery & Icons: Any illustrative elements (including the fox mascot) should tie into the palette – e.g. orange for the fox, teal/blue for supporting graphics. On hover or interaction, animate colors by adjusting brightness or saturation (for instance, lighten the orange slightly on hover). These small effects complement the playful, tech-savvy vibe.
